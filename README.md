# base
Number base conversion module in Python

This is a simple number conversion module in Python that will convert from any base not greater than 36 to any base not greater than 36.
It contains three function definitions:

    dec2base(num,base) converts num from decimal to base.  It works only with integers.
    base2dec(base,num) converts num from base to decimal.  It works only with integers.
    numconvert(frombase,tobase,num) converts num from frombase to tobase.  Integer only.
